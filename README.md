# Android Boilerplate

Android boilerplate app that showcases architecture and libraries used at adesso Turkey.

There are two simple list-detail pages to show basic implementations followed.

For more detailed implementation, please have a look [Android sample app][sample-app] developed with this Android boilerplate.

## Prerequisites

- #### Keystore details (Release builds only)

To be able to build the application with release configs, keystore details should be set. It would be enough to rename `keystore.properties.sample` file as `keystore.properties`, and update the content.

Keystore file will be resolved at root level `build.gradle` file if the build variant is `release`.

Here is a sample `keystore.properties` file:

```
RELEASE.STORE_FILE=./papara.merchant.keystore
RELEASE.STORE_PASSWORD=password-for-store
RELEASE.KEY_ALIAS=alias-for-key
RELEASE.KEY_PASSWORD=password-for-key
```

## Development

### Code style [*](https://github.com/VMadalin/kotlin-sample-app)

To maintain the style and quality of the code, are used the bellow static analysis tools. All of them use properly configuration and you find them in the project root directory `config/.{toolName}`.

| Tools                             | Config file                            | Check command                | Fix command               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------:|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [detekt][detekt]                  | [.detekt.yml](/config/.detekt.yml)     | `./gradlew detekt`           | -                         |
| [ktlint][ktlint]                  | -                                      | `./gradlew ktlint`           | `./gradlew ktlintFormat`  |
| [spotless][spotless]              | -                                      | `./gradlew spotlessCheck`    | `./gradlew spotlessApply` |
| [lint][lint]                      | [.lint.xml](/config/.lint.xml)         | `./gradlew lint`             | -                         |
| [gradle versions plugin][gvPlugin]| -                                      | `./gradlew dependencyUpdates`| -                         |

All these tools, except [Gradle Versions Plugin][gvPlugin], are integrated in [pre-commit git hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), in order
ensure that all static analysis and tests passes before you can commit your changes. [Gradle Versions Plugin][gvPlugin] can be run optionally. To skip them for specific commit add this option at your git command:

```properties
git commit --no-verify
```

It's highly recommended to fix broken code styles. There is [a gradle task](/build.gradle#L57) which execute `ktlintFormat` and `spotlessApply` for you:

```properties
./gradlew reformat
```

There is another gradle task [`checkFormat`](/build.gradle#63) which executes `detekt`, `ktlint`, `spotlessCheck` and `lint` to check the code style:

```properties
./gradlew checkFormat
```

The pre-commit git hooks have exactly the same checks as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and are defined in this [script](/config/scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit.sh). This step ensures that all commits comply with the established rules. However the continuous integration will ultimately be validated that the changes are correct.


If you want to know more about naming convention, code style and more please look at our [Android guideline](https://github.com/adessoTurkey/android-guideline) repository.

## Architecture

- Single Activity
- MVVM Pattern

**View:** Renders UI and delegates user actions to ViewModel

**ViewModel:** Can have simple UI logic but most of the time just gets the data from UseCase

**UseCase:** Contains all business rules and they written in the manner of single responsibility principle

**Repository:** Single source of data. Responsible to get data from one or more data sources
